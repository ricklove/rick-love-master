### Dork

Dork is a short text adventure inspired by Zork.

It's a game I made for my kids and my own enjoyment after playing with the original Zork source code.

It's full of ironic humor and interesting ways to die, just like a text adventure should be:

Plus a few modern features, like achievments:

And interactive elements:

It even has animated ascii art:
