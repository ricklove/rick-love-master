tl;dr 20 years of software engineering boiled down to the most minimal course as a foundation for any scale app.

### Summary

In this course, you will create a full-stack web-app from scratch.

***You*** will ***write*** and ***understand*** every line of code. 

You won't depend on external code that hides away important functionality. You will use only a few foundational frameworks/tools that give you full control over everything: React + Serverless Framework. 

You will publish your app and host it using Netlify and Aws. Your app will easily scale to handle millions of users, but it will cost nothing for the free tier (which will handle thousands of users). However, you code can easily be modified to be hosted anywhere.

Everything will be written in Typescript. Everything will be perfectly typed. Everything will be under your control giving you full power.

The code architecture and file organization will teach you how to build an app of any size without introducing additional complexity.

### Cost

Dedicate your life to serving others and be passionate with everything you do.

I want to give you the best of my skills so that you can use those to the benefit of others.

I want to empower you to make a positive impact everywhere.

Be thankful and love others.
