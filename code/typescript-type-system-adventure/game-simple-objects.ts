 * ### Summary
 * 
 * So this was written for fun!
 * 
 * ### Note: 
 * 
 * This is a work of fiction. It's not code that you can run or anything. It's a fun toy playing with the typescript type system.
 *
 * Feel free to learn and make your own, but please give me credit for coming up with the idea with this link:
 * https://ricklove.me/typescript-type-system-adventure
 * 
 * ### Inspiration:
 * 
 * Also this was inspired by this amazing SQL typescript type system parser:
 * https://github.com/codemix/ts-sql
 * 
 * ### Sharing
 * 
 * **Please share it with all your nerd friends!**
