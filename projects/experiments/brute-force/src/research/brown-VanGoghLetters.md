// 7 In number 5...this is the name of the last place I called home. (Brown)

839
To Theo van Gogh. Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, on or about Monday, 13 January 1890.

I tell myself that at _home_ in _Holland_ people always value painting more or less, that in an establishment they’d hardly make difficulties about letting me do it.

883
To Joseph and Marie Ginoux. Auvers-sur-Oise, Wednesday, 11 June 1890.

The latter knows a lot about painting, and likes mine very much, he encourages me a great deal, and two three times a week he comes to spend a few hours with me to see what I’m doing.
They have twice written an article about my paintings, once in a Paris newspaper and the other time in Brussels, where I had exhibited,1 and now, lately, again in a newspaper of my own country, _Holland_,2 and that means that a lot of people have been to see my paintings and that I’ve sold on better terms.3 And it isn’t over. It’s anyway certain that since I stopped drinking4 I’ve done better work than before, there’s still that which has been gained.
But I still often think of you all, one can’t do as one wants in life, one must leave the place one feels most attached to – but the memories remain and one remembers – obscurely as in a mirror5 – absent friends.
Thus I hope that the dispatch can take place on Saturday. 1v:3
Here is the address again.
