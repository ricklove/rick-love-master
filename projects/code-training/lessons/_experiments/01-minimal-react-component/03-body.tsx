import React from 'react';

export const MinimalReactComponent = (props: {}) => {
    /* # Body
    Objective: Enter the Entire Body of the React Component
    Explanation:
    We now want to examine the entire body of the react component.
    The react output is written in a languange called JSX which stands for JavaScriptXml.
    Enter the return statement with the most common pattern to render the 'Hello World' html.
    Descriptions:
    The return statement marks the output of this component.
    The (...) parathesis are normally used to wrap a JSX block.
    In our standard we will end every statement with a ...; semicolon.
    Experiments:
    <span>Hello World!</span> => <div><span>Hello World!</span></div> ::: JSX Supports nested elements just like html.
    return ( => return &&& ); => ; ::: The () paranthesis are not always required, but they are recommended.
    ); => ) ::: The ; semicolon is not required, but we will always use it.
    */
    return (
        <span>Hello World!</span>
    );
    // # END
};
