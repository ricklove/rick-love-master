Chilpillwill:
    I made this track with the intention of recreating the feel from the 
    original game, Doomguy trudging through the Toxic Refinery. My track has 
    quite a dark feel with a pushing/driving rhythm  - the game is well 
    underway at this point and the enemies and challenges are starting to 
    intensify. Composed in Cubase with the Roland SC-55 v3.7 SoundFont - 
    levels/mix may sound different depending on playback system! MP3 will be 
    made available for anyone who wishes to compare with the original 
    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peqggu5uuRw).

Ivan Stanton:
    Thanks to everyone who contributed to this pack and thanks to the Doom 
    community for being so welcoming and letting me as a newcomer run this MIDI 
    pack project. I think it went really well!
    
    INTRO and INTROA: INTRO is just expanding on INTROA, which came first. I
    think it's fitting to have a medley in a part of the track that only will
    be heard if you don't see the demos - whether you have demos or not, you
    get a preview of the levels this way, sort of.
    
    E3M9: For the most part, this is just an electronic dance version of Hell 
    Keep. I was kinda inspired by all of the "Nobody Told Me About id" remixes
    in Plutonia tribute projects.
    
    BUNNY: Wanted to do something SFX-heavy despite my MIDI sequencer not being
    designed for it. Don't think it matches up with the animation quite as well 
    as the original music, but that's okay.
    
    E4M1: I made this track back when this was supposed to be a solo Thy Flesh
    Consumed MIDI replacement. The chord progression was nearly stolen from
    Final Fantasy VI's Dancing Mad, though I think the rest of the song is
    quite different.

Keagan Dunn:
    "They're Going to Get You" has always resonated with me, mainly in E4M6, 
    though. I attempted to keep to that song's style and the atmosphere it 
    gives off, while also branching out with my own ideas - especially after 
    seeing how the Doom 2 MIDI pack guys did their tracks.

Lippeth:
    Composed in Logic Pro X for MacOS with Apple Quicktime Music Synth, 
    RLNDGM.SF2 and Roland Sound Canvas SC-55mkII
    Finalized in Sekaiju for Windows using Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth and 
    Roland Sound Canvas SC-55mkII

    E1M9: "You're Winner"
    I wanted to get the most out of as few instruments as possible. Synth brass 
    1 and distortion guitar both have a nice high frequency presence that 
    complement each other when panned at opposite sides and comfortably fill 
    both the low and high end without needing much help from other instruments. 
    Because this is the first secret map, I felt that it needed an upbeat, 
    triumphant, and familiar sound, and attempted the classic 12-bar blues 
    structure, as well as Bobby Prince's trademark major harmonization during 
    the second round, while also injecting my own personality into the song.

    E4M5: "Let the Wicked Be No More"
    Leaning into the biblical theme of the episode, I felt that choir ahs 
    should take the lead for most of the song, reminiscent of medieval 
    Christian music but with harmonies, as well as guitars and drums so you'd 
    have something to groove with while wading in blood, hunting for keys. The 
    marble textures led me to hint at phrygian dominant notes here and there 
    for more of an ancient mysterious feeling, as well as adding a harp to give 
    a sense of wonder. The ambient bass line at the end was inspired by the 
    band Death, and the heavier riff it goes into is based on "Extinction Level 
    Event" by The Vicious Head Society, another recording project I am involved 
    in.

    E4M7: "Path of the Pale Horse"
    Continuing with biblical tone, the choir ahs are still present, though to a 
    lesser degree. The map title references a bible verse depicting Death 
    riding a pale horse, so that idea influenced the theme of the entire song. 
    The large amount of wood textures made me want to use the nylon string 
    guitar. The few tech base elements led me to incorporate the square wave 
    for certain sections, and the almost symmetrical but somewhat off layout of 
    the main hallways made me want to reflect that feeling, so most of the song 
    is done with a time signature of 11/4.

Manniacc:
    [E2M8] is inspired by 80's thrash metal, mostly Metallica. Whereas most of 
    those are tuned in E standard in the key of E Minor, this track would be 
    played in D standard on a real guitar, and as such is written in D Minor to 
    reflect the darker tone. And the title is a reference to Doom Eternal.

    MIDIs created with Cakewalk Pro Audio 9.03.

NeilJohnRips:
    Made using Sekaiju. Just tried making a song that epitomised Doom in song 
    form. 10% horror, 90% action :D Only definite music influence was Doom 2 
    Map 4's music for the funky drum bits. Special thanks to JimmySquared for 
    introducing Sekaiju.

Palitoman:
    I worked with LMMS to create the track and did some volume tweaks on the 
    exported midi with Guitar Pro 5.

    The idea of the track came after playing some random notes on LMMS while 
    getting used to it. The MIDI has a little reference to the original E2M8 
    track "Nobody Told Me About Id" (one of my favorites), it's just a few 
    notes.

    Also you've recently arrived in Hell, so, why not make something like a 
    heart beating and some passing by screams?
    I would like to thanks my friends Willian Lovato and Matheus Goulart for 
    giving me some tips and to Ivan Stanton for letting me contribute on this 
    awesome project.  
    
Peccatum Mihzamiz:
     This is my third MIDI ever. MAP E3M3 has several distinct sections that 
     inspired me to make a piece with different contrasting 'feels' in it. I 
     started with a whimsical dance that had low brass coming in at some point. 
     I ended up using that low brass as the starting point of 'Eclectic Death', 
     and discarding the rest. Special thanks to Lippeth and Cammy for helping
     me finish this track!

Sego:
    a lot of inspiration comes from progressive metal, but i used a funk base 
    to make this one, changes in time signature were a requirement for me but a 
    total challenge in the process, i would like to experiment on other kinds 
    of doom songs, more ambiental, but as intricate as this one and the ones 
    before. Many thanks to northivanastan for this opportunity and Peter for 
    the feedback.

TrialD:
    **Pagliacci's Going To Town**: I always wanted to do a MIDI that was in the 
    vein of Mr. Bungle's debut album (the single reason music instruments were 
    invented in the first place lol). While I'm not 100% sure if I nailed that 
    vibe I'm glad with the mix of clown music and thrash metal regardless.
    **They Are Going To Suspend You**: Ever since I listened to the Project 
    Doom remix of "They Are Going To Get You" I kept thinking: "Damn, that with 
    the instruments of Suspense would be pretty sick". This MIDI pack gave me 
    the opportunity to do just that. Special thanks to Peter Lawrance for 
    giving me ideas for the final movement of this track.
    **World Of No Sorrow**: A rather spontaneous entry to the MIDI pack that 
    wouldn't be too out of place in the first Age of Empire's OST. Inspired by 
    a desire for a world where people no longer have to suffer from needless 
    cruelty.

Xulgonoth:
    My main inspiration here was GloomKeep by David Shaw, I wanted to do 
    something similar, but more sinister (so I took more inspiration from 
    Aubrey Hodges in the first half) and with a more drastic breakdown for the 
    second half. I think I pulled it off pretty decently, probably mainly 
    thanks to the augmented scale, which I was trying out for the first time 
    here, but it was surprisingly fun to work with. But you should still go 
    listen to the original GloomKeep, it's from Memento Mori II and it's 
    amazing. Also I'd like to give special thanks to Bloo, who helped me out 
    whenever I reached a creative block while making this.
