# EntityDesc vs EntityInstance

- EntityDesc
  - Template
    - Simple to use as a prefab to generate multiple entity instances
  - Serializable (savable/loadable)
    - Contains full world initial state
    - With a persist function, it would be possible to save all active world state
  - Cross platform
    - It is implementation agnostic, so can run on any implementation of the component set
