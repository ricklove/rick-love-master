It uses a simplified version of gatsby to generate a static website with async loaded components. That is hosted on netlify which basically provides free https, simple dns management, and git deploy with auto CDN cache expiration. In addition, I use serverless framework cli to define my AWS infrastructure and deploy the serverless stuff from command line. Essentially, I can make anything and deploy it in about 30 secs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Some Interesting Things\r\n\r\nSome interesting things:\r\n\r\n- The Site Header\r\n\r\n    - Really figure this out. It goes very deep. (try 'dir' or 'ls', also useful: 'open')\r\n\r\n    - dork - A text adventure (inside the header console simulator)\r\n\r\n        - I'm ofter adding to this.
