Why not a text adventure!\"\r\n\r\nNow, it turns out that the way I implemented this game, I don't need the 4.1 features. I'll probably add that in the future to support more dynamic command parsing.\r\n\r\nIf you have `vscode`, you can play now with a quick `npm install` into any node project. (See below for full installation instructions.)\r\n\r\n### So What?\r\n\r\nThis is a level 99 typescript wizardry demo. \r\n\r\nIf you aren't a typescript nerd, you might miss the significance of this, but here is the basic idea:\r\n\r\nFirst of all, everything you see here is running in the vscode code editor (without any program running). In fact, you can't even run my code. If you compile it to javascript, this is what you will get:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const gameStart = null;\r\n```\r\n\r\n(There might be a little more debris then that, but you get the idea.)\r\n\r\nThis screenshot should make it clear that the typescript type system is doing all the work:\r\n\r\n![](game-screenshot-04-type-only.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not very convenient to declare all those StepNN types, so I made a fluent mode that reduces the need for those:\r\n\r\n![](game-screenshot-01.png)\r\n\r\nThere is also an easy mode that uses only an object tree. It was very easy to make, but autocomplete ruins the fun by giving all the answers away. \r\n\r\n![](game-screenshot-05-easy.png)\r\n\r\nIn the process of making the game, I discoved that vscode supports jsdoc markdown. So I decided to use that for the game output since it is so rich. It even supports images:\r\n\r\n![](game-screenshot-03.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n- Play in vscode using autocomplete and tooltips\r\n- Game output displayed in tooltips using jsdoc3 with markdown (including gifs)\r\n- Implemented using conditional types, string literals, and a minimal state machine\r\n\r\n### How to play\r\n\r\n- `npm i @ricklove/typescript-type-system-adventure`\r\n- Create a new `play.ts` file and add the below code\r\n- Hover over `execute` to see game output (see screenshots for examples)\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { gameStart } from '@ricklove/typescript-type-system-adventure';\r\n\r\nconst play = () => {\r\n\r\n    return gameStart\r\n        .command('look').execute\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tips:\r\n\r\n- `.command('look').execute` will give you an idea of what to do next\r\n- `.command('help').execute` if you get stuck\r\n- If you really get stuck, just hit F12 and read the source code\r\n- You can also play the easy mode with this starter:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { gameStartEasy } from '@ricklove/typescript-type-system-adventure';\r\n\r\nconst playEasyMode = () => {\r\n    gameStartEasy\r\n        .begin()\r\n        .look()\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![](game-screenshot-01.png)\r\n\r\n![](game-screenshot-02.png)\r\n\r\n![](game-screenshot-03.png)\r\n\r\n![](game-screenshot-04-type-only.png)\r\n\r\n![](game-screenshot-05-easy.png)\r\n\r\n![](game-screenshot-06-large.png)\r\n\r\n### Source Code\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ricklove/rick-love-master/tree/master/code/typescript-type-system-adventure","title":"Typescript Type System Adventure","headers":[{"key":"title","value":"Typescript Type System Adventure"},{"key":"date","value":"2020-10-24"},{"key":"path","value":"/typescript-type-system-adventure"},{"key":"author","value":"Rick Love"},{"key":"excerpt","value":"Text Adventure implemented in the Typescript Type System and Vscode JsDoc Viewer"},{"key":"image","value":"game-screenshot-06-large.png"}],"body":"\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Play a text adventure in vscode with the typescript type system.\r\n\r\n### Update - Added Typescript 4.1 Template String Literals\r\n\r\n![](/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/typescript-4-1-features.png)\r\n\r\n- [Source on Github](https://github.com/ricklove/rick-love-master/blob/70644a0f6cebf48132fc029e484e6f8db9e3fc19/code/typescript-type-system-adventure/game-type-system.ts#L123)\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nI've always been a fan of text adventures since I first played Space Quest 1 when I was about 6 (though it was a graphical text adventure technically).\r\n\r\nI've also always been a huge fan of typescript since it came out in 2012.\r\n\r\nNow, since Typescript 4.1 is adding the powerful template-literal-types, I figured I could do something fun with them.\r\n\r\n(I got the idea from here: https://github.com/codemix/ts-sql)\r\n\r\nIt occured to me, \"Hey!
