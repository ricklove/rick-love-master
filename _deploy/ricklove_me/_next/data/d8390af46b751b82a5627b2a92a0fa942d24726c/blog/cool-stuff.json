It uses a simplified version of gatsby to generate a static website with async loaded components. That is hosted on netlify which basically provides free https, simple dns management, and git deploy with auto CDN cache expiration. In addition, I use serverless framework cli to define my AWS infrastructure and deploy the serverless stuff from command line. Essentially, I can make anything and deploy it in about 30 secs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Some Interesting Things\r\n\r\nSome interesting things:\r\n\r\n#### Site Header\r\n\r\nThis is my favorite - it's a console/terminal simulator full of old school text-based/ascii games + a modern twist (interactive react components in some cases).\r\n\r\n(try 'dir' or 'ls', also useful: 'open')\r\n\r\n![](/media/blog-content/posts/2020-09-30-cool-stuff/console.png)\r\n\r\n#### Dork\r\n\r\nA text adventure (inside the header console simulator)\r\n\r\nI'm ofter adding to this.
